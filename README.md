## What is ContextMatic?

Coding agents hallucinate APIs. APIMatic Context gives them curated, versioned API and SDK docs.

When a developer asks their agent to "integrate the payments API," it normally guesses, pulling from outdated training data or generic patterns that don't match the actual SDK. ContextMatic solves this by giving the agent authoritative, version-aware, SDK-native context at the exact moment it's needed.

## Try It Now

Install ContextMatic in your coding agent:

<a id="cursor-install"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

> *Prerequisite: Cursor v2.6.14 or higher is required for ContextMatic*

1. Install the MCP server with this one-click.
   
[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=context-matic&config=eyJ0eXBlIjoiaHR0cCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2hhdGJvdGFwaS5hcGltYXRpYy5pby9tY3AvcGx1Z2lucyIsImhlYWRlcnMiOnsiWC1BcGltYXRpYy1NY3AtQ2xpZW50IjoiQ3Vyc29yIn19)

This Cursor deeplink embeds the Cursor-specific MCP configuration directly and adds the MCP server only. 

2. Ask your agent to install the bundled skills from these files:

- [plugins/context-matic/skills/integrate-context-matic/SKILL.md](plugins/context-matic/skills/integrate-context-matic/SKILL.md)

## ACP PayPal Plugin

The marketplace also ships **`acp-paypal`** — a PayPal-focused plugin built on the same SDK-native context engine. It adds the `acp-paypal-server-sdk-cs` MCP server, an `/integrate-paypal` skill, and two specialized subagents:

- **`paypal-plan`** — a read-only planner that produces a precise, SDK-contract-grounded PayPal integration plan (endpoints, models, auth) before any code is written.
- **`paypal-debug`** — diagnoses and fixes PayPal API issues in your project, verifying every change against the MCP server.

Install it alongside (or instead of) ContextMatic:

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

1. Install the MCP server and add this repository as a marketplace, then install the plugin:

## Supported APIs

The plugin gives the agent SDK-native context for the following APIs, available in TypeScript, C#, Python, Java, PHP, and Ruby:

| API | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Adyen API** | Payment processing: retrieve payment methods, create orders, manage stored payment tokens |
| **Google Maps APIs** | Location services: geocoding, directions, distance matrix, elevation, roads, and places |
| **PayPal Server SDK** | Payment flows: orders, payments, vault, transaction search, and subscriptions |
| **PayQuicker API** | Payment and financial services: program agreements, bank accounts, spendback quotes |
| **Slack API** | Workspace automation: OAuth bots, messaging, conversation management |
| **Spotify Web API** | Music and podcasts: library management, playback control, discovery |
| **Tesla Fleet Management API** | Vehicle and fleet operations: charging history, vehicle commands, energy management |
| **Tesser API Portal** | Digital payments: payment intents, onchain payments, app management |
| **Twilio API** | Communications: SMS, voice, video, and verification services |

This list is growing. [Suggest a new API](#contributing) to request support for one not listed here.

---

## What the Plugin Gives the Agent

Once installed, the plugin exposes four tools to the agent. Each tool is mapped to a specific stage of the integration workflow:

| Tool | Developer task it enables |
|------|--------------------------|
| `fetch_api` | Provide an exact api match or lists all available APIs with their name, key, and description. Pass your project's language and an API name as `key` for an exact-match lookup (returns only that API). The full API catalog is returned if no exact match is found. The agent calls this first to discover which APIs are available. |
| `ask` | Chat with API Copilot for step-by-step integration guidance and general API questions: authentication setup, client initialization, feature behavior, framework-specific patterns (e.g. "How do I initialize the Twilio client in Laravel?"), and idiomatic SDK code samples. |
| `endpoint_search` | Returns an SDK endpoint method's description, input parameters, and response shape by method name. |
| `model_search` | Returns an SDK model's full definition and its typed properties by name. Call this before writing code that constructs request bodies or reads response objects. |

For step-by-step guidance on using these tools together, invoke the `/integrate-context-matic` skill in your agent. It tells the agent when and how to call each tool throughout your integration workflow.

---

## From Prompt to Code: How the Tools Work Together

The four tools are designed to chain together in a natural integration workflow. Here is a concrete example of what happens under the hood when the agent receives a real task:

**Your prompt:** _"/integrate-context-matic Add Twilio SMS notifications to my Next.js app. Send a text when an order ships."_

| Step | Tool called | What it returns |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | `fetch_api` (`language=typescript`, `key="twilio"`) | Exact match found — returns Twilio's entry with its name, key, and description |
| 2 | `ask` (`key=twilio`, query=_"How do I initialize the Twilio TypeScript client?"_) | Returns exact SDK setup code with auth configuration |
| 3 | `endpoint_search` (`query=createMessage`) | Returns the method signature, required parameters, and auth requirements for the SMS send endpoint |
| 4 | `model_search` (`query=CreateMessageRequest`) | Returns the full typed request model with every available field |
| 5 | `ask` (`query="How do I handle delivery status callbacks in Next.js?"`) | Returns webhook handling code aligned to the Twilio SDK |

Each step completes in a single tool call. The agent handles the orchestration. You describe the goal, and it picks the right tool at the right time.

![paypalsampleapp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc3e5b02-934e-44b5-9df9-20387557babe)

**What was built:** A full Node.js/Express storefront with product management, shareable checkout links per product, PayPal Smart Payment Buttons, server-side order creation and capture, and a payment history dashboard.

**The prompt:**
  
```
/integrate-context-matic Build me a "PayPal Instant Storefront" app.
The app has a setup page where I enter my PayPal client-id and secret once, then
a product creation form where I enter a product name, description, price, currency,
and upload or provide product images. When I click "Generate Checkout Page" it
creates a live, shareable checkout URL like /checkout/abc123 that anyone can open —
they see the product details with images, price, description, and a working PayPal
Smart Payment Button. The payment flow should be fully server-side using the PayPal
Server SDK: backend creates the order when buyer clicks pay, captures it after
approval, and shows a confirmation page with order details. I should be able to
create multiple products and each gets its own unique checkout link I can share
with anyone. Include a simple dashboard where I can see all my products and their
checkout links, plus a list of completed payments showing order ID, buyer info,
amount, and status for each product. The checkout pages should be mobile-responsive
and look like real professional product pages. Support sandbox and live mode via
environment variables. Only use the Orders API and Payments API, do not use
Transaction Search or Vault. Make it deployable with npm install and npm start.
```

**How the tools were used:**

| Step | Tool | Query | What it returned |
|------|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | `fetch_api` | `language=typescript` | Available APIs; identified PayPal Server SDK with key `paypal` |
| 2 | `ask` | SDK setup & environment switching | Client initialization code, `.env` structure, sandbox vs. live config via `Client.fromEnvironment` |
| 3 | `ask` | Order creation flow | End-to-end create → approve → capture flow with full TypeScript server-side code |
| 4 | `endpoint_search` | `ordersCreate` | `CreateOrder` method signature, `OrderRequest` body structure, response type `Order`, error codes |
| 5 | `endpoint_search` | `capture` | `CaptureOrder` contract — required `id` param, optional body, capture ID location in response |
| 6 | `model_search` | `OrderRequest` | Full request model properties; flagged `payer` and `application_context` as deprecated |
| 7 | `model_search` | `Money` | Currency code and value fields for structuring amounts |
| 8 | `ask` | Smart Payment Buttons | Frontend button integration — `createOrder` / `onApprove` wiring to backend endpoints |
| 9 | `endpoint_search` | `getOrder` | `GetOrder` method signature and response shape for the confirmation page |
| 10 | `model_search` | `PurchaseUnitRequest` | Full model with `amount`, `items`, `shipping`, and all optional fields |
| 11 | `model_search` | `Order` | Full response model — `status`, `purchaseUnits`, `links` (including the `approve` redirect URL) |

**App outcome:**

- One-time credential setup page with live sandbox validation
- Product creation with name, description, price, currency, and image upload
- Unique shareable checkout URL per product (`/checkout/abc123`)
- Server-side order creation and capture — no client secrets exposed
- Confirmation page with order ID, buyer info, and capture details
- Dashboard with all products, total revenue, and payment history
- Mobile-responsive checkout pages
- Deployable with `npm install && npm start`

![spotifySampleApp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63556c36-ba2d-417c-978c-5a4697e9b4e2)

**What was built:** A Python/Flask web app where users authenticate via Spotify OAuth, fetch their top artists and tracks, retrieve audio features in batch, and analyze the data to produce a personalized "Music DNA" card — featuring a radar chart of average audio features, top 5 genres, most obscure artist, and a generated personality label — with a download/share button. Custom branding only; no Spotify logos.

**The prompt:**

```
/integrate-context-matic Create a web app using Python where users log in with Spotify,
fetch their top artists and top tracks, then fetch audio features for those tracks.
Analyze the data to calculate average audio features, find the most obscure artist,
determine the top 5 genres, and generate a "music personality" label based on the
averages. Render all of this in a visually appealing DNA card with a radar chart,
top genres, most obscure artist, and personality label, and include a button to
download or share the card. Use your own branding and logo; do not include Spotify
logos anywhere.
```

/integrate-context-matic I want to add real-time order shipping notifications
to my Next.js store. Use Twilio to send an SMS when the order status changes to
"shipped". Show me the full integration: SDK setup, the correct endpoint and its
parameters, and the TypeScript code.

## Measured Impact

Tested across four PayPal API integration tasks on two production-grade .NET applications — same task, same IDE (Cursor), same model (GPT-4.1 High), run with and without ContextMatic. Here's what changed:

| Metric | Agent only | Agent + ContextMatic | Change |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| Compile / runtime errors | 16 | 1 | ↓ 91% |
| Prompt iterations | 34 | 16 | ↓ 54% |
| Token consumption | ~57M | ~20M | ↓ 65% |
| Manual fixes | 11 | 0 | ↓ 100% |
| Hallucinations | Multiple per run | 0 | ↓ ~Zero |

Code quality scores improved from an average of **~3.0 to ~4.8** across architecture, modularity, error handling, and readability.

## How APIMatic Generates context for an API

![API integration using ContextMatic](assets/images/image.png)

APIMatic takes your OpenAPI specification through the same SDK generation pipeline it uses to produce idiomatic, type-safe SDKs in 10+ languages. The resulting MCP server exposes the SDK documentation and integration patterns as structured tool responses that AI assistants can consume natively.

This means the context the AI receives is:
- Derived from actual generated SDK code, not raw documentation
- Inclusive of idiomatic patterns, typed models, and error handling
- Aligned to the current version of your API spec

For API providers: [request a demo](https://www.apimatic.io/request-demo) to generate context for your API.

## Repository Structure

This repository is a **multi-plugin marketplace** that targets Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code. Each plugin carries one manifest per IDE, and each manifest points at its own MCP config file so it can send an IDE-specific telemetry header.
