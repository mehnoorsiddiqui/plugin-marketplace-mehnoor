Configuration is not an options object here. Everything is either a **constructor keyword** on the
client (`python-client-initialization`), a field on a **server config model**, or a **per-call
`request_options`**. There is no third place to look.

## What this SDK does not do for you

Read this before designing around a capability you assume exists. The generator emits **none** of the
following, so each is yours to build or deliberately do without:

| Capability | Status | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| **Retries / backoff** | none — ruled out by design | Wrap your own call; see below |
| **Pagination helpers** | none — no iterator, no auto-paging, no cursor | Drive the loop yourself (`python-calling-endpoints`) |
| **Streaming / SSE** | none — responses are fully buffered `bytes` | Not available through this SDK |
| **Request/response logging** | none — no hook, no event | Wrap the transport; see below |
| **Circuit breaking, rate limiting** | none | Your own, around the call |
| **A mock/offline mode** | none | Point `base_url` at a mock server, or supply a fake transport (`python-testing`) |

What the SDK *does* own: the request pipeline, auth application and token caching, response decoding,
error mapping, connection pooling, and one timeout.

## Server and base-URL configuration

Server selection is **not** an environment enum. What the constructor accepts depends on what the
description declares, in one of four shapes — take yours from the contract sheet, grounded in the SDK
map's *Servers & auth* section, which names the environments and servers this SDK declares and so
settles which arm it is:

| The API declares | Constructor keywords |
|---|---|
| one server, one environment | `base_url: str \| None = None` |
| one server, several environments | `environment` (a string literal alias with a default), then `base_url` |
| several servers, one environment | `server_config: {Server}ConfigOrDict \| None = None` |
| several servers, several environments | `environment`, then `timeout`, then `server_config` |

```python
client = {Api}Client(base_url="https://api.example.com", {scheme}=...)   # base-url arms
client = {Api}Client(server_config={"{server}": {"base_url": "..."}}, {scheme}=...)   # config arms
```

Where a `server_config` is taken it is a pydantic model with a dict companion, coerced through
`.coerce()`, holding **one field per server the API declares**; each of those carries that server's
`base_url` and any template variables.

**Omitting the server keyword takes the description's own default, and that default is whatever the
spec listed first — for many providers a sandbox.** Nothing announces it. A deployment that believes it
configured production and did not gets sandbox behaviour with production credentials, which fails auth
in a way that looks like a credentials problem, not an environment one. Pass the server explicitly in
every environment, production included.

**Server template variables are only reachable in the `server_config` arms.** They are fields on the
config class, so where the constructor takes a `server_config` you set them there. Where it takes a
`base_url`, the client builds the config itself — there is no path to a variable, and your only lever
is replacing the whole URL with `base_url`. Variables always carry a declared default (a constant or an
enum member), so a call still works untouched; it just goes wherever the default points.

Resolve the environment from configuration with an explicit map and **fail on an unknown value** rather
than falling through to a default:

```python
BASE_URLS = {"sandbox": "https://sandbox.example.com", "live": "https://api.example.com"}
base_url = BASE_URLS[settings.environment]     # KeyError beats a silently wrong environment
```

Where the SDK manages OAuth, **the token endpoint is derived from the same server**, so environment and
auth can never drift apart. Pointing `base_url` at a mock server or recording proxy therefore redirects
the token fetch too.

## Retries — there are none

**This is the headline fact, and it is the opposite of what most SDK generators do.** There is no retry
policy, no backoff, no pipeline to configure. An architectural decision record rules retries out of the
request path deliberately. Concretely:

- A `429` or `503` raises on the first attempt. Nothing is resent.
- A connection reset raises. Nothing is resent.
- Even the one place that looks automatic — a `401` — is not a retry. The cached credential is
  invalidated so the *next* call re-authenticates; the failing request is not resent. You see one
  `401`, then recovery.

Two implications, and the second is easy to give away by accident:

1. **Whatever retrying your integration needs, you write**, outside the SDK call. There is no knob.
2. **You inherit no accidental duplicate writes.** A failed write was attempted exactly once at the SDK
   layer. That is a genuinely valuable property — do not discard it carelessly when you add retries.

### Adding retries yourself

Use `tenacity`, `backoff`, or a plain loop; wrap **your** call, and decide per operation:

```python
import httpx
from tenacity import retry, retry_if_exception, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential_jitter
from {root_package}.core import ApiError

def _is_transient(e: BaseException) -> bool:
    if isinstance(e, httpx.TimeoutException | httpx.ConnectError):
        return True
    return isinstance(e, ApiError) and e.status_code in {429, 500, 502, 503, 504}

@retry(
    retry=retry_if_exception(_is_transient),
    stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
    wait=wait_exponential_jitter(initial=1, max=10),
    reraise=True,
)
def fetch(resource_id: str):
    return client.{group}.{operation}(resource_id)      # a read: safe to retry
```

Rules to hold to:

- **Retry idempotent reads freely; treat every write as a separate decision.** A write that timed out
  may have succeeded — a reset after the bytes reached the server is indistinguishable from one before.
- **Never retry a `ValidationError`, or a 4xx other than `429`.** They cannot succeed on a second try.
  A decode failure in particular is not transient (`python-error-handling`).
- **Respect `Retry-After`** when present: `e.response.headers.get("retry-after")` — header keys are
  lowercased, so look it up that way.
- **Cap the worst case.** `attempts × timeout + backoff` must sit below whatever deadline your own
  caller works to, or you are burning provider capacity for a response nobody is waiting for.

### Making a write safe when you retry

Some write operations declare an **idempotency-key parameter** — a header the provider uses to collapse
a duplicate submission. Whether a given operation has one is per-operation and visible only in its
signature, so **check before you assume**; in practice a description declares them on some writes and
not others.

Where one exists, generate the key **once per logical action** and reuse it across every attempt:

```python
request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())                       # once per logical action, not per attempt
client.{group}.{operation}(body, {idempotency_key}=request_id)
```

Two things the signature will not tell you, both of which need the provider's own documentation:

- **Whether the provider actually enforces it.** The parameter existing is not a guarantee that a
  resend is deduplicated.
- **The retention window.** Keys expire, and windows differ per API — so a resend after a long backoff
  may no longer be collapsed.

**Where an operation has no idempotency parameter, retrying it is a real duplication risk.** The safe
recovery is to re-read state and decide, not to resend. Some such operations are naturally idempotent
(cancelling an already-cancelled resource is usually harmless), but that is a per-operation judgement —
make it deliberately rather than retrying the whole class.

## Bounding a call — what the timeout actually bounds

One knob, in two places:

```python
client = {Api}Client(timeout=10.0, {scheme}=...)                    # every request
client.{group}.{operation}(arg, request_options={"timeout": 3.0})   # this one request
```

- The value is **seconds, as a float**; the per-call option overrides the client's.
- It must be **> 0**. The constructor raises `ValueError` otherwise — and rejects NaN too, since the
  guard is written `not timeout > 0`.
- The default is **30 seconds**, which is far too long for anything on a user-facing request path. Set
  it deliberately.
- Under the default transport, one float sets connect, read, write and pool timeouts alike. To separate
  them (a short connect, a longer read), build your own transport with an
  `httpx.Timeout(connect=..., read=...)` and pass it as `custom_http_client`.

**Because there are no retries, the timeout genuinely bounds the call.** Worst case is one timeout, not
attempts × timeout. That simplification is what the no-retry design buys you — and the moment you add
retries, the arithmetic above becomes yours.

**If you supply `custom_http_client`, the client's `timeout=` no longer reaches the wire.** That value
only builds the SDK's *own* default transport. Set the timeout on the transport you pass, and honour
`request.timeout` inside it (`python-client-initialization`).

For async callers, a deadline over a whole operation — the SDK call plus your own surrounding work — is
`asyncio.timeout(...)`. It raises `TimeoutError` through the await, which no `except ApiError` clause
will catch.

## Proxies and TLS

The default transport takes these directly, and you pass it in yourself to set them:

```python
from {root_package}.core import HttpxClient

transport = HttpxClient(timeout=10.0, proxy_url="http://proxy:3128", verify=True)
client = {Api}Client(custom_http_client=transport, {scheme}=...)
```

- `verify` accepts a bool **or an `ssl.SSLContext`**. A private CA bundle or a client certificate is
  configured by building a context (`ssl.create_default_context(cafile=...)`) — that is the supported
  spelling for either.
- **Standard environment variables are honoured by default**: `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` /
  `ALL_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` (consulted only when `proxy_url` is unset), and `SSL_CERT_FILE` /
  `SSL_CERT_DIR` for the trust store. This is request behaviour your deployment can change without
  touching code — worth knowing when a container behaves differently from a laptop. A caller who needs
  it off supplies their own transport.
- **`verify=False` disables certificate verification.** It is not a debugging convenience for anything
  carrying credentials; fix the trust store instead.

## Logging — wrap the transport

There is no logging hook and no event to subscribe to. The transport protocol is the seam: implement
it, delegate to the real one, and log around the call.

```python
import logging, time
from {root_package}.core import HttpxClient

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class LoggingTransport:
    def __init__(self, inner): self._inner = inner

    def send(self, request):
        started = time.monotonic()
        response = self._inner.send(request)
        log.info(
            "%s %s -> %s (%.0f ms)",
            request.method, request.url, response.status_code,
            (time.monotonic() - started) * 1000,
        )
        return response

    def close(self): self._inner.close()

client = {Api}Client(
    custom_http_client=LoggingTransport(HttpxClient(timeout=10.0)), {scheme}=...
)
```

The async version is the same shape with `async def send` and `async def aclose`.

**Log the method, URL and status — not headers or bodies.** The auth header carries a live credential
and bodies carry whatever the API moves; neither belongs in your logs or your traces. If you must
capture a body to debug, gate it behind a flag that is off by default and redact before writing.

This same wrapper is where OpenTelemetry spans, metrics and request-id propagation belong.

### Verify on the wire (first run of any new call)

On success the SDK returns the decoded body and nothing else — never the URL or status. So a wrong path
parameter, a header you thought you set, or a query parameter that silently did not serialize produces
**no in-band signal**; the only symptom is a `404`/`422` that looks like a provider problem.

Run the logging transport the first time you execute any new call, and check:

1. the **method** matches the operation;
2. the **path** has no unsubstituted `{placeholder}`;
3. path segments carry **wire values** — an enum's string, not a Python member name;
4. the **query parameters** you set actually appear.

Then gate the wrapper behind a debug flag.

## Connection pooling

The client holds one pooled transport. Reuse the client and close it on shutdown; a client per call
pays a fresh TCP and TLS handshake every time, and under managed auth a fresh token fetch as well.
Under forking servers (Gunicorn, uWSGI, Celery prefork), construct it **after** the fork — a pool
inherited across `fork()` is shared by processes that each believe they own it, which surfaces as
intermittent, unexplainable connection errors. See `python-client-initialization`.
